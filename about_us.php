<p>We are strong believers in the philosophy that hard-work and willpower is much more beneficial than the traditional education route, which is very expensive.  Our philosophy is bringing back something of what you have learned throughout your life to help others achieve their highest potential.  For us, we want to offer quality education on technological related issues for free.  We believe that every action has a reaction, and therefore with every breathe you take, you can make the world a better place.
</p>
<p>
Every time you help someone you also get a piece of joy in return. We call that piece of joy a bringback.  Although, bringbacks aren’t worth much in the physical sense of the word, we believe in the idea that it will come back around and help us when needed.  If you like the idea of helping others and changing the world for the better, we call you a bringer.
</p>
<p>
We as an organization also want to share the good news of Jesus Christ.

<ul type="disc"><li>“Not everyone who says to Me, ’Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. Many will say to Me on that day, ’Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’ And then I will declare to them, ’I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.’” - Matthew 7:21-23</li></li></ul>
